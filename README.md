# PyStochastica

Ever wanted to form arbitrary, linear and non-linear transformations on collections of random variables
and study their properties? PyStochastica is an open source Python library tailored precisely for this! 
It leverages SymPy to provide a framework in which to implement stochastic calculus of random variables.
