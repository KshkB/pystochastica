PyStochastica Documentation Page
================================

``PyStochastica`` is a Python library for random variable and stochastic algebra. 
It aims to be a general purpose, computer algebra system for discrete and continuous 
random variables which is easy to use and maintain.

**Note.** As of writing, ``PyStochastica Discrete``, i.e., the algebra of discrete 
random variables, has been completed to a workable library.
