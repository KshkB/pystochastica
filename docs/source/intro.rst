Introduction
============

``PyStochastica`` aims to be a general purpose, symbolic calculus system for discrete and continuous 
random variables. This is in much the same vein as Python's ``SymPy`` library for mathematical 
variables (i.e., elements of coordinate rings).

**Note.** Any constant can be understood as a random variable with definite outcome. Random variables 
thereby generalise *constants* rather than mathematical variables.
